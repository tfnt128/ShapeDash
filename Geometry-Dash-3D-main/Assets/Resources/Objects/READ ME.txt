This is the folder where ALL the objects used in the game go.
If you place ANY prefab in here, then it will become a new object with a unique autogenerated ID attached to it.
Remember to mark the objects fields with the "LevelSave" attribute if they should be saved in the JSON file.
Only do things with this folder if you know what you're doing.
